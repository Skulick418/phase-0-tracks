#PSEUDOCODE
# Creating a program that asks what the input is, inserts that input into a hash, and then allows for updates.
	#Ask for user information, set userinformation as value for key variable we will create
		# gets.chomp will be equal to hash_name[:key_name]
	#Create loop that will break if the answer returned is done.
		#Otherwise the user will put in a keyword that will go to a key that will lead to an update.
			# Have new answer be equal to the value of the existing key 
	# End program
