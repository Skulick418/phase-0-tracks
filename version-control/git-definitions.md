# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
It allows for multiple coders to work on one piece of master code without interfering with each other.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is used as a seperate workplace away from the master code. You would use it to update your code, get it perfect, and then merge it back to the master code.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point. It allows one to go back to previous versions of ones string in case they need to.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when multiple merges are running the same line of code and Bash can not merge everything. It identifies this error as a merge conflict.
