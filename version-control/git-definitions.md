# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows for changes in a file or files to be recorded in a way that you can go to them later if need be. It is useful because it allows one to go back to previous versions of a code.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a way to work with the same material as the master code without actually interfering with the master code until it is ready. You would use one so you can work on a project without breaking the master code. When you finish with your code in the branch you can then merge it to the master code.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a message to yourself and other coders telling them what you did to the code before saving it. A good commit message is concise, clear on what it has done, and uses the present tense. 
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when multiple people are branching off the master code and attempt to merge their code back to the master but they run into problems and git comes up with the error merge conflict. What is happeining is that git is automatically trying to merge as much as it can and when it runs into something it can't merge it labels it as a merge conflict.
